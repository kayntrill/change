My Rust learning Journey based on the Harvard CS50 first problem set, the original solution was supposed to be written in C but because I am learning Rust I have decided to use it instead. 
The solution uses the greedy algorithm to calculate the number of coins to be given out. 
It has been optimized to reduce the reputation for each denomination by using a for loop and an array to represent the denomination for each coin.
It also includes error handling for the input.
